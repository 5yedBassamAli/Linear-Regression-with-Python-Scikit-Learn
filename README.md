# Linear-Regression-with-Python-Scikit-Learn
Hello My Friend ,I am experiencing this task during the intern by Spark Foundation.
i had learned a lot of things ,i am thanking to the Spark Foundation that helps me a lot of things during that intern.
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
